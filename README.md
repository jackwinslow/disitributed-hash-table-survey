# Distributed Hash Tables

Abstract
With the increasing popularity of distributed systems and applications, distributed hash tables have become more relevant given their ability to manage widespread partitioned resources. By implementing a lookup service to work in coordination with a modified hash table, data search can become highly efficient and fault tolerant. This is ideal for building applications on top of peer to peer networks, which fare better under high traffic in comparison to the traditional client-server model. In this paper we identify the processes behind distributed hash tables, as well as highlight what makes them so important. We then detail current applications of distributed hash tables, and explore future implementations that could benefit modern technology.
